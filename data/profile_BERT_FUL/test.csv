Travel good. Expose staff good. And it appears the “mission” statement is that 2.5-3million American lives were not lost so Yay us and Yay “the President”...still doing my drinking game: shot every time VP says “the President” . #USER# Ummm, the “mission “ began while he was POTUS, about his practices as a private citizen so alleging political agenda against a private citizen is cloudy and alleging she sees HIM as a political opponent is untrue (and laughable) “who she views as a political opponent,” . #USER# Was Eric upset that big brother’s fiancée was getting all the sexy photos attention? . #USER# Work as “staff” at a K-12 school so many kids are vaccinated; my work is mostly with MS/HS and keeping them masked properly indoors is a constant and daily battle.

0	obviously the correct answer when choosing to have to be racist or transphobic in front of libs is to be transphobic. “being racist” still means something the normies the way “being transphobic” simply doesn’t. . #USER# wow full circle. it’s like his own personal “is it your money” moment. #URL# . i simply do not give a fuck about anything that may or may not have happened to any ethnic or religious community anywhere in the world for any reason if it’s the reason you’re trying to police the discourse in 2021. . #USER# okay well i’m referring to sam river gian and their orbiters. do with that information what you will. 🤷🏻‍♂️ . leave it to radical feminists to live in 2022, see the all out assault the left is waging on normal people, and pearl clutch over the funny jokes of people who agree with you about the left and are explicitly not feminists. . #USER# yeah but i’d feel bad cause i know she’s just a mentally ill psy-op victim. jordan peterson talks about this in his talk with paglia . if no one bought any merch, i’d buy my ticket to afghanistan myself and i’d be able to do it without asking my upper middle class nigerian parents (thanks for the melanin!) or sucking methheads off in the florida panhandle to do it.   get a fucking job 🙄 . if pressed on this, like the GOP leftist he is, he’ll say some shit like “*trans*men can, but *trans*men are *trans*men” instead of saying. transwomen are men.  and transmen are women. it’s the GOP leftists mystification technique. see #USER# do it here: #URL# #URL# . #USER# obviously not because it’s a disgusting and repugnant take on it’s face. my question is why people like you think you’re saying something relevant by dismissing the clip for its age. . the left: trans people are working class!  reality: #URL# . #USER# if someone claims to have a “gender identity” they are signaling that they are an anarchoradlib utopian socialist aligned with the democratic party and the woke bonapartist faction of capital (tech pharma defense finance) &amp; the deep state. saves a lot of time . #USER# look at my libertarian editor bro, we’re gonna end up in a bio-security state 😔 . #USER# #USER# #USER# you see. it’s called living in material reality. the thoughts in my head and what i consider myself are not what make me a man. if you guys we’re idealist anti-marxist utopian socialists. you’d know this. see #USER# at 28:00 #URL# . “these take-sellers and cryptoleftists don’t even interact with him, why is he still critiquing their politics and the role they play in the discourse”  -literally the first person to accuse you of being “parasocial” with media people #URL# . ur tax dollars r being spent to indulge the regressive sexist delusions of criminal lumpen in prisons - who at any moment can be placed in womens prisons to threaten their safety at their most vulnerable. leftists when presented with these facts will tell u ur doing culture war #URL# . i’ll never forget back in august when the Afghan puppet regime’s “National Army” was posting shit like this right before it dissolved into thin air. #URL# . that twinkrev orbiter who loves mel gibson is the biggest two faced fence sitting 🚬🐐 i’ve ever seen in my life. will like every negative tweet about me then when in a voice chat together “oh i listened to barebactrian it was good ☺️” . hey. this guys 100% new to twitter. never seen him before, but i think you should all follow #URL# . why does he look like a white joanne the scammer #URL# #URL# . #USER# LOL i wish! the left are anti-marxist utopian socialists with anarchist tendencies. they’re transhumanist scum. please don’t compare them to the chinese. the CCP have *built* the anglosphere left can only *destroy* . calls for representation are just disguised requests for a category in pornhub so that you can leverage an implanted fetish to your sexual benefit . the mall downtown is a ghost-town, and after seeing it packed during the holidays, it’s kind of a black-pill, these bug men don’t want to return to normal. . i think more people should watch this season of drag race. it feels like the absolute cutting edge of the progressive project: from gender to covid . catch up on episode one here and help support my trip to The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan by buying some overpriced merch at #URL# #URL# . leftists are always trying to convince non-leftists to be leftist-lite   “listen i don’t need you to agree with transing EVERY 8 year old, but we do have to agree that some men give birth if we’re gonna get everywhere” #URL# . #USER# which is y its such a ball of wax that is impossible to make make sense. the amorphousness is its strength. that way the lefts friends can spew the most regressive nonsense but ppl outside the left can be unpersoned for stating biological facts that werent controversial 5 yrs ago . #USER# trust the science™ : the science that says masks and lockdowns work. that the jab is safe and effective. that the world is ending in 12 years from climate change. that there are six sexes and that caitlyn jenner is a woman. . fellas. this big fat transphobe shows up to your new years party with a huge tray of shrimp, you letting him in? #URL# . the left coalition is animated by a worldview that hates nature, the human body, &amp; the material world itself. its no wonder so many of their projects: from abortion to girlbossery to gender ideology prey on women bc they are the singular manifestation of all the things they hate . there is the left bonapartist faction in power currently and and their PMC-lumpen footsoldiers. it is the left and the anti-left. the most far right wignat boogeymen that cryptolibs point to as representative of the masses to mystify for the left are not an organized force . “call me fragile one more time mf” #URL# . mine is fully addressed and therefore my politics are perfect #URL# . you cant bully someone who is bullied by mirrors and reality itself. . someone doing the work for the left (consciously or as a useful idiot), will tell you this man isn’t a conservative..but then again theyll also tell you some men are women and that passing laws to put them in women’s prisons is “culture war” #URL# . knowing and being vocal about knowing what a man and woman is isn’t the same as explaining it’s connection the the leftist project and presenting it as a litmus test to weed out the post leftist leftists months before they exposed themselves . the “in the pants” line is really cute coming from NAMBLA leftists. but fine idc what’s “in your pants” what was written on your birth certificate under “sex” #URL# . these people are gonna pretend people weren’t telling them at the time that this is what the lockdowns and the CARES Act were for. even worse they’re gonna pretend they were on the other side of the issue. #URL# . #USER# im just informing you. im literally not asking/telling you to do anything. my point being i’m not trying to be coy/cute about who/what i’m referring to. . idc how petty it is, i like to be told what’s said about me behind my back. . #USER# in this acute moment of crisis beginning in march 2020, it’s the left and everyone else. #URL# . #USER# a democrat will always accuse their enemies of exactly what they’re guilty of . so why was MSNBC re-airing it between segments in the fall in the context of the VA gubernatorial race? #URL# . something tells me it won’t be a male juvenile facility. but according to leftists this is okay because we haven’t spent public fund building a separate special wing for the “LGBTQ” lumpen #URL# #URL# . “omg why are they doing X? “Trans people” dont even want X! No “real trans person is asking for X”nnsweetie i hate to break it to u. its ideology. its useful. it serves a material purpose &amp; benefits the left. it has nothing to do with ppl diagnosed with so-called gender dysphoria #URL# . not that being offended matters for shit but also as a man it’s offensive cause this roided out chick and think she can talk to me like a man but if civility breaks down and i was to lay him out like an actual pipsqueek man i would be in the wrong for hitting a woman #URL# . this mf a mf’ing court jester #URL# .

Here’s a pickle:  On one hand, a crazy hottie does well to date someone whose family is equally or + crazy, because said man doesnt mind crazy.  BUT if they have kids, said kids may be super crazy.

Sugar had a desk elevated on a raised platform- and he would bark out orders to the minions Awful environment they said . #USER# No wonder Labour coffers are empty… It costs a hell of a lot of money to buy this level of Management Consultancy advice  … and graphics . ⁦#USER#⁩ having an excellent seeded bagel at ‘North &amp; Ten’ in Muswell Hill by ⁦#USER#⁩ They have loads 🙋🏽‍♂️ #URL# . #USER# Dear Andrew You have seen ‘evidence’ that most Courts of law would find compelling. Question is are you man enough (if I can use that term) to admit that the Establishment bubble you rescind in has obscured your ‘true &amp; fair’ vision ❓ And Are you man enough to now be contrite 🤷🏽‍♂️ . #USER# #USER# This is such a badly written hatchet job My guess it’s by guest writer ‘Ratbiter’ or as he is better known, the famously objective, measured &amp; forensic Nick Cohen (I could be wrong) . #USER# To add - anyone in Politics or MSM or TV Expressing real clear anti Semitism are no longer in their jobs. On the other hand being racist is almost table stakes to get *onto* some MSM programmes / columns So obvious  So shameful . #USER# Calm during the (political) storm Aaron  You that is  ... not the Establishment &amp; their MSM Surrogates ‘playing politics’ to grab the wheel of the car as it plunges off the Brexit/Covid cliff . #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# You mean abuse from this man? Jailed for abusing #USER# in 2016 *NOT* a Labour man … a Far Right person! Please read &amp; then reconsider that maybe you have been cynically mislead (then wonder who did this &amp; why) #URL# . #USER# #USER# #USER# Karl  Please stop with the cultish admiration  ‘If’ Starmer is as good a Leader as you claim … You really don’t need to be Telling us every single day  Really you don’t  (In other news … can I tell you that Bitcoin is a really really great &amp; sound investment 🤭) . #USER# Pot &amp; Kettle spring to mind when I read these rather puerile ad hominem attacks . You are ultimately judged in life by those who respect you …and those who don’t  Based on this output You seem to be on the same side as ‘The Many’ 🙏🏽 . #USER# Brilliant Clive 👍🏽 Even more so given you must be so so busy dealing with multiple requests to appear on BBC Radio 4 Today, Newsnight and Peston ... Looking forward to the headlines tomorrow in our MSM - rightly highlighting this shameful cover up . “Make high-speed internet available everywhere in America -- so no parent has to sit in a parking lot for their kid to access the internet for homework” #USER#  What a great idea President Biden 👍🏽 If only WE had a politician with that vision (&amp; a supportive MSM) #HASHTAG# . What a sad, ungracious &amp; rather nasty Tweet #USER#  We can all agree Corbyn lost GE19  All those aware of the facts *also* know *as you do*; ✅He got more votes than last 3 Labour Leaders 🟩the industrial scale MSM smearing had a part to play🤷🏽‍♂️ ✅now Unraveling in law courts #URL# . #USER# I hear that Hancock’s Pub Landlord friend has got the contract to supply them... Don’t scoff ... how hard can it be 🤷🏽‍♂️ . #USER# At University in the 70s my friends could not understand why I would play ‘Shirley Bassey - Live at Carnegie Hall’ so much … Whilst also liking Roxy Music, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd … Great documentary on Sky Arts the other night👍🏽 . Just listened to #USER# on #HASHTAG# &amp; struck by her life enhancement reference to “Being Grateful” I can really relate to this My Tamil Mum instilled this in me 🙏🏽 By happy coincidence I saw Lyse this week talking about #HASHTAG# with #USER# at the Conduit Club #URL# . #USER# #USER# #USER# I canvassed for #USER# as well 👍🏽 Once for 2 hours just me and her. Another day my wife &amp; I were abused outside Bounds Green tube by a man who hysterically screamed; “I hope you both burn in Hell” I thought he was going to assault us Her silence is disappointing 😕 . #USER# #USER# What a strange comment? Are you not interested in principles being applied consistently &amp; fairly? . #USER# Ignoring the colour coding (this was 50 years ago) this would aptly fit the difference between a Tory &amp; Labour ‘Centrist’ … Once the Fox has bared their teeth and bitten (showing their true colour) … they can become a Tory Lord Wolf  IMO . #USER# He got Knighted for his service … so presumably someone high up was happy with what he did do  …. And didn’t do  IMO . #USER# I just checked this #USER# account &amp; found I am also Blocked by him/her I’m clearly in good company 👌🏽 . #USER# Everything is relative … I suppose given some of the dull uninspired relics he has gathered around him - in *relative* terms he appears *charismatic* 🤦🏽‍♂️ . #USER# You are a Star 🌟 Well fought &amp; argued Dawn (Incredible how only *now* is it “deeply offensive” to call a Political Party “institutionally racist”🤦🏽‍♂️) . #USER# #USER# Yup “that vote” that sealed the century old hostility between Spurs &amp; Gunners... Lamala was caught up in the whole drama . #USER# #USER# #USER# I’m not sure your fine distinction of having to be ‘living’ in a physical place (Moscow) to be ‘associating/ aiding’ is at all relevant. On that basis no one can accuse Trump of being a Putin stooge.  Question is … Why are *you* so “desperate” to defend the indefensible . #USER# #USER# Er … let’s see now🤔 🤔because he was the Head of CPP 🤔He earned &gt; than the PM 🤔He got Knighted for his efforts  WHY are you trying to defend the frankly indefensible- around such a serious crime 🤷🏽‍♂️ It’s not insight - it’s *not* having my head deep in the sand . #USER# #USER# #USER# What’s with this quaint “tribalism” reference 🤷🏽‍♂️ Buy &amp; read this weeks #USER# it’s all there IMO Foreign media barons, foreign Governments &amp; proxies, foreign VC / hedge funds should NOT be allowed to fund ANY UK political party/MP/Adviser  Do you agree Neil❓ . #USER# You forgot … ‘Decent folk are Barnacles on a Boat’ . #USER# Eric is either: 1. A BOT 2. Based in USA 3. Based in Russia 4. Aged 14 . #USER# I recall Jordan Peterson on #HASHTAG# trying to spin; “The Best &amp; the Brightest” end up in Parliament as MPs Tragically for The Many this is not the case . #USER# I wonder how #USER# under Viner as Editor would have treated a South African apartheid regime ‘if’ it *still* existed … 🤦🏽‍♂️ . #USER# #USER# #USER# So I can ignore the begging letters from Labour HQ … pleading for donations? Good to hear . #USER# Corbyn is the ‘Cuba’ of British politics He simply *cannot* be allowed to be seen as a success of any kind. Despite the gross smears made by Tory MSM that courts of law have found against, the Establishment ‘Spanish Inquisitor’ wants him to recant &amp; PLEAD “Yes the World IS Flat” . #USER# #USER# You are a BOT I guess ... So based in St Petersburg ❓ . #USER# I guessed correctly that you are a ‘Journalist’ Emma … when I read your straw man Tweet (or Torrancing perhaps?) I left Labour because of the nasty racist disclosures in #HASHTAG# &amp; Starmer’s (who I voted for) complicity in burying #HASHTAG# Hope that is clear to you🤦🏽‍♂️ . #USER# If there is zero dissent from the Leader … Doesn’t it then make it a *Dictatorship* Just saying . #USER# #USER# #USER# Not quite up there IMO with 200 people handcuffed &amp; transported out of this Country having lived here for 50 years losing families  Losing all rights 10 subsequently dying Or nearly 100 people assaulted after #USER# referred to “letter boxes”  #HASHTAG#  #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# The term of choice is I believe; *Vile, Grotesque Cesspit* . #USER# 2 of the favourites to be the next Tory prime minister are the product of people moving to this Country (you know from abroad) 🤦🏽‍♂️ . #USER# Ian you have inadvertently explained some of the pressing reasons *why* an Independent Scotland makes sense … If I lived in Scotland I would vote for Independence from the 2-party English Establishment controlled by foreign media Barons Then those issues can be sorted👌🏽 . #USER# In the last 3 years Ms Philips spent a lot of time defending a community facing prejudice .... I don’t recall her moderating her message with this type of ‘perspective’ IMO ‘if’ anyone had made such a remark I’m sure it would have launched another 1000 outraged Guardian articles . #USER# The boys on the beach ... I recall the official spokesperson said; “Their mothers sent them out to play *knowing* they would die” Chilling then Chilling now . #USER# Is this another case of #HASHTAG# Matthew? Simultaneously outraged at (checks notes) *slurs* against Starmer - whilst enthusiastically participating in #HASHTAG# 🤷🏽‍♂️ #HASHTAG# . #USER# Journalists are stirring (finally) #USER# has THREE cartoons in the current edition on the conflict. ALL THREE are critical of Israel . #USER# Happened this week Milk was ‘fresh’ Monday Curdling by Thursday . alert The people who blame Corbyn for our Brexit quagmire -rather than well ... the Tories &amp; our fabulous Free Press are the ultimate #HASHTAG# !! Because they think Corbyn has the Super Power to right every wrong. Now that really is cult like delusion 🤦🏽‍♂️ #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I would wager that 200,000 is a underestimate  The fact so many *ex* members are still getting “will you pleeze canvass” emails suggests Labour Party membership department is grossly disorganised - and have no idea of actual membership numbers . #USER# #USER# #USER# Here’s the difference in outlook between us: I can see good &amp; bad points of Biden I think on balance he is a “force for good” I am prepared to wait &amp; see. You can only see the negative You studiously avoid acknowledging positives like climate policy, more USAID &amp; healthcare Why? . Not only is this a great story of courage &amp; ‘making a difference’ I’ve had the privilege to work with Sadia &amp; the charity ⁦#USER#⁩ Sadia Hussein: the FGM survivor saving girls from the knife | Female genital mutilation (FGM) | The Guardian #URL# . #USER# #USER# You say “moderate” Rachel I say “right wing” who would be more comfortable in the Tory party. My evidence: Just look at the enobled ex MP Lords ... by Johnson no less Or those ex MPs happy to work for gambling companies or Utilities or PR firms. Or take £1m + to “run” a charity . #USER# #USER# #USER# What an odd remark🤷🏽‍♂️ Wishing someone goodwill is a meaningless activity ‘if’ the recipient doesn’t trust / respect the ‘giver’ As the ‘giver’ Starmer has encouraged a rather nasty following (IMO) His words to me are mere platitudes… like Johnson’s. . #USER# I dunno … Maybe because the Media gifted him his 80 seat majority  By smearing the decent alternative 🤷🏽‍♂️  And NOW *some* of the Media realise the implications &amp; are being allowed by their Owners to speak 🤷🏽‍♂️ . #USER# #USER# #USER# And … the racists are the ones telling us this about Corbyn… 🤦🏽‍♂️ IMO . #USER# “Keir Starmer has done such a good job of detoxifying the Labour brand” says All the Proxies for Murdoch, Rothermere, Barclays… Fixed it for you Kerri . #USER# #USER# I recall Pele always being asked; “who was the best goalkeeper you played against “ and “Gordon Banks” was the answer. Even back then I thought if he was in Italy his answer would have been Zoff … We really have delusions about our prowess devoid of ‘Trophies’ . Just finished #HASHTAG# by ⁦⁦#USER#⁩ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Deeply insightful, thought provoking &amp; moving  As the only Asian (with my sister) in my 60s infant/junior schools also very cathartic  Best book of 2021 for me 👏🏽 My Mother in Law &amp; daughter are now reading it🙋🏽‍♂️ #URL# . #USER# Precisely  And of course (sadly) the very same applies to the BBC … (Notice how NO satellite photos of troop build up have been shown) 🤷🏽‍♂️ . #USER# #USER# Fair enough Tom Both my wife &amp; I voted for Starmer in the leadership election - I trusted him when he talked about the 10 pledges, public ownership &amp; Corbyn being “a friend”. We both left a few months in disgust later when #HASHTAG# failed to be published by Starmer Sad times . #USER# I’m surprised no one has blamed #HASHTAG# voters of being (checks notes) “anti Semitic” yet … After all this is the reason (excuse) being tested for why no one votes Labour in #HASHTAG# . #USER# Incredible if this type of robust interview had occurred consistently in 2019 we would be having a #USER# government right now  Journalists like #USER# #USER# have culpability for the whirlwind we have reaped . #USER# If the Liverpool Manager made it obvious he preferred another team ... Or the Coca Cola MD said ‘Pepsi was better than Coke’ Or Samsung CEO said he used an iPhone ... Or an MP made it very very clear their values were not in line with their Party ... It’s clear what would happen . #USER# *Bombshell revelations* Really Piers? Me thinks your exclaim too much (on this one topic) #URL# . #USER# #USER# You have been a rare light of consistent integrity in our MSM Jon  👍🏽🙋🏽‍♂️ . #USER# I think anyone asking for Johnson to publish Sue Gray’s report “quickly &amp; in full” … should be asked directly about the #HASHTAG# delay . #USER# Not sure I agree with you Chris This type of story has ‘cut-through’ Crazy #HASHTAG# didn’t cut through in the case of Corbyn in 2017 But eventually the Right found crazy #HASHTAG# Voila! On door steps this did impact in 2019 I bet #HASHTAG# will come up in pubs &amp; cafes . #USER# The man who (mildly) assaulted me on #HASHTAG# day as I manned a polling station with a Labour rosette on … mentioned ‘ERHC’ as his rationale/ proof … that his actions were justified  The man who screamed “I hope you Burn in Hell” as I gave out leaflets a week earlier likewise
