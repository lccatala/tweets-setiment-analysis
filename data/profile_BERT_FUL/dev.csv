Oof, qrts are missing the point that many folks (esp poor white USians) position themselves as anti-capitalist not from a liberationist mindset, but rather out of self-centered annoyance at being poor.

They don't "think" that  It's just the Fake Woketep anti Biden populist trope  How are the SAME folks that swear off college because it's a scam and push tech scams ALSO in financial ruins over student loan debt  Maff is funny  Most of them didn't even vote, they're just agents #URL# . I DEFINITELY know married women and attached women who have favorites on this app(me) that aren't their husbands or boyfriend's  Must be rough for both parties lol knowing a nigga on the TL makes you lady tingle more from tweets than they do in their actual lives lol #URL# . I think she was the obvious big booty exception but it kinda indicates how fascinated white folks were with big assesnnSo I THINK white men in particular had a fetish even in secretnnBut big asses weren't en vogue until the turn of the century #URL# . I even cracked a joke to see if she was serious and she said females do it on vacay all the time lol  But she didn't get any more head from me the next couple days #URL# . lol I always wonder how females see and process the game lol  This is hilarious #URL# . Why did niggas look so old back then  The homie was 16 when he was murdered and looks 26 in these pics #URL# . That's the reason Ant Man is under house arrest in Ant Man 2 #URL# . Seeing females shovel snow or cutting grass or carrying groceries or really doing anything strenuous always makes my heart hurt . Edge Of Tomorrow is really a quality movie ya'll . Energy is always crazy Friday night in Vegas . I have the "report issue" tab already ready in case the driver is on that fuck shit  Full refund and credit me please #URL# . This is beyond debate  Lowkey next to Asian culture they have the strongest family units in the game  And pandering on social media isn't a barometer of such  Those Hispanic dudes are out building houses they're not simping for pussy on twitter like incels #URL# . Attention is like heroin for females and social media is their fix  I can't conceive of all the dopamine the female brain secretes when a pic goes viral  But I share this sentiment but centered around unintelligent thoughts  I can't believe stupid people are so brazen on here #URL# . Black folks struggle and grind for success JUST so they can flex and throw it into another black person's face still in the strugglennThey never have that energy or smoke for the system that creates the need for struggle tho . BETTER question lol   When did Trump run HIS companies like a "good CEO" string of bankruptcies along with being sued by contractors for lack of payment  The good businessman shit is Republican trope #URL# . Been such  But funny thing is Lauryn Hill warned us in Doo Wap(That Thang)  Industry literally hasn't given us a single mainstream female emcee that doesn't rely on overt sexuality/hypersexuality to sell  Not a single one, this is on purpose #URL# . If not wifing up a ran though whore makes me "vanilla" then so be it internet stranger  Good luck out there! #URL# . Good to know someone else disagrees with the blatant tokenism going on in Hollywood and the "Girl power" movement is bullshit and gender doesn't matter  Refreshingly nice to hear from a female #URL# . Integration is vitally important in a capitalist society because you have the freedom to shop for the best/cheapest price  Instead of being price gouged because of lack of competition and forced commerce  Hoteps/Fake Woketeps don't realize this economic reality . Wow  I miss the brotherhood of a football locker room man #URL# . Wedding vows are a trip when you think about them  It's gotta be somewhat emotional to look a woman in her eyes in front of her family and everyone she loves and PROMISE to always and forever have her back and be her natural support . I wonder this each time she tweets or DMs me  Like I meditate on this thought #URL# . Black men from a certain socio-economic demographic suffer from PTSD   Like for real for real are in need of mental health relief . Yeah that's crazy he's lowkey a bust kinda #URL# . Because even if that's true Brugge still bought him  So you can logically deduce they discussed playing time and opportunities  Also they never played Horvath so I don't give them the benefit of the doubt  Plus Owen is still a teenager..... #URL# . I think being like 45-35 is the perfect age and era to have been born into  A little earlier and we're stuck playing with Slinky and Pong on a Coleco while listening to 45's  A little later and our entire sense of identity and self worth is shaped by strangers and social media . If you voted for Donald Trump to be President of these United States you're NOT qualified to speak on the qualifications of others #URL# . I have NOTHING in common with a hood rat ghetto ass bitch other than the fact we both happen to be black  hard pass  my lady has to be upwardly mobile just like I am #URL# . #USER# Thank you!!! lol gotta beat the drug test tomorrow but I'm gucci . That's what Manchin and Sinema hang their hats on with their local constituencynn"Hey we got you fine people the most benefits we could without helping any of those black and brown folks"nnThat's how they get reelected #URL# . Off The Wall is right there with a photo finish tho #URL# . Watch this turn into a challenge or SNL sketch tho lol #URL# . If you think "black Americans" are aboriginal then you definitely took the short bus to school and sat in that class that had 7 students and 12 teachers #URL# . You got heart for a skinny chick I'll give you that  Weight classes exist for a reason lol that wasn't a fair one that got handed out   But you didn't back down #URL# . Also what's funny is the victim tried to apologize for the perpetrators actions based on her gender and sexual orientation  Had to school her on how NEITHER are relevant  What she did is no different than if a male colleague casually groped you then intimidated you for rejection . NahnnThere's fundamental core differencesnnWhich is why TWO Senators from pretty much red states can prevent progress in the name of "not letting black/brown folks advance"nnThe "both sides are the same" is Fake Woketep twitter drivel #URL# . He obviously misjudged your character for a well adjusted nurturing type female  Hope God speaks to his heart before we end up being subjected to screenshots as well #URL# . Lemme tell you this lol  I pulled this BAD ass white bitch white and she came over (pops let me have female company) and hung out then per the agreement my dad took her home  But she wanted me to drop her off around the corner tho lmaooooooo  The way my dad looked at me bruh #URL# . "college is a scam" morphed into "you don't need a degree for this" which turned into "get this tech cert for easy money" which is now "I play in the crypto/stock market"  If black folks exerted the same energy into education as they do trying to get rich quick we'd be winning . Miami is like a real life crucible for female friendships  Lowkey a rite of passage #URL# . Who cares about cap space when it's a toxic dumpster fire of an organization??  Fish stinks from the head and the Jags are a train wreck  That's not an ideal landing spot for a young coach trying to establish himself as a HC #URL# . I'm not "mad"  And why does my opinion matter to you so much internet stranger  Feel free to be impressed by the nigga that places seeds in the ground and watches them grow into shit  Free country, just dick ride OUT of my mentions please #URL# #URL# . Same way poor white people think Mexicans are taking their jobs lol somehow Hoteps/Fake Woketeps perpetuated the "white women are taking our men" fallacious trope  So now there are accounts DEDICATED to hating on white women because they're the blame for them being forever single #URL# . Oh.....  So you're just a pandering lame nigga for kicks then huh  Log off and hunch on your wife loser #URL# . I'm highly motivated lol I'm outside the Top 25 and I'm running a championship caliber program over here lol #URL# . Fun Fact: TikTok is owned and ran by the Chinese government as a way to data mine and commit espionage on Americans  For what reason in the WORLD would you share this with anyone  Much less an enemy foreign government #URL# . Her tweets definitely hit different once you've been inside her . Same height and body frame lowkey  And then the dominance  But it wasn't ever really a like for like comparison of their respective games per se  Just his level compared to his peers and the buzz coming out of HS was similar to Bron #URL# . Not in a sexual abuse case lol  This isn't rocket science or anything  Same way ex cops wouldn't be optimal in a police brutality case #URL# . *black man head nod*  And nah l thank YOU  You're the hella fine one here deserving of gratitude #URL# . That's subjective analysis and personal bias  And obviously if there are black men expressing a preference outside their race they don't share the same priorities  If you're okay with one type of performative based tweeting then you have to be okay with the other #URL# . Ohhhhhhhhh okay lol yeah not much could be done unless she's a scandalous bitch or it was truly love at first sight  Was she a bad bitch?? #URL# . I mean it's Jersey and population density to land mass is already an issue  I can't imagine they strictly enforce zoning laws the same way Midwestern and Western states with more area do  But this is just an educated guess and it's not like you're wrong either #URL# . I tell people all the time black women aren't a monolith and to not talk about them as such  But nobody cares when it's in the form of pandering but everyone reacts when it's under the realm of dating preferences or cultural observations #URL# . New blacks have NO issue allowing their kids to grow up believing there's 37 genders but also refuse to let their kids believe in Santa Claus  Maff is funny  Takes way less imagination to believe in a fat man going down chimneys worldwide in a single night than to deny biology . Guess we need Brooks to transfer to the MLS and run around the pitch not doing much with the ball for Berhalter to properly rate him #URL# . This is üì†  The difference between how women receive and treat their men is always culturally/socio-economically based  It's not a race issue  Women are women and more importantly black women aren't monoliths  If she was raised to see men as objects to love not tools of survival #URL# . Here's the issue tho.....  With VERY few exceptions (pre med/pre law/journalism) your major really matters not in corporate  They just want to know you possess the discipline to start and finish  Hella successful people work in a field outside their chosen emphasis/major #URL# . Yeah she's a lame ass basic bitch  lol you can tell this because she doesn't even know the difference between "worst" and "worse" lol  Get this bitch the fuck outta here #URL# . I mean he's a Helton guy   But I hope he finds a solid home lol like Mizzou #URL# . If we all sat in the same room and tweeted I guarantee 99% less sass and aggression would be on the TL  If the constant threat of getting the shit smacked or beat out of you was there you'd see how these niggas really move and vibrate . Of course you're rightnnBut "colorism" is how insecure and ineffectual black folks virtue signal and get to pretend how "black" they arennSo light skins have to catch strays so incels can get RTs and attaboys from femcels on this appnnWho listens to radio/podcast and thinks color #URL# . Only thing missing is her holding a big slice of pizza folded over and a Metro card #URL#

1	#USER# I think history is going to look back at an age, and not just one presidency. What lead to a Trump-like figure being able to take the highest office in the land (world?). How did a nation become so polarized? What happened to the 4th estate and holding governments to account? . #USER# In looking through websites on the 1918 pandemic, it seems there were two very vocal camps then, too. The issues were masking and movement restrictions only, but perhaps this is just humanity(?). . #USER# Thanks for sharing. "Things are more like they are now, than they ever have been before." :) . I just accomplished a major ‚úÖ at work. Thought I was going to miss my deadline for the first time in 11 years. Now I want to hear that MLB has a deal!!! . #USER# #USER# If you want a different team in charge, why not write an op-ed talking about how CPC needs a bigger tent with plans that speak to the vast majority of voters (center L/R). Easy to criticize when your party can't get elected. It's CPC who's taken away choice  from voters. . #USER# Taking the lump sum would generate (very conservatively) $200K a year in investment income. Even if you spent half of it, the balance would generate $100K. I'd take the lump sum. Solid investments would generate more than these amounts. . ^ I'm old enough to remember when all cookbooks looked like this. #HASHTAG# #URL# . Twitter kicked MTG off the platform. Perhaps they finally listened to #USER#'s in-depth analysis?  It's a good day for sane people everywhere. #URL# . #USER# :) Last night's broadcast on 60 minutes will have an effect for sure. I hope they can nail him for something. Either way, regulate these things so they are accountable for the impacts their platforms have. . #USER# I read the whole thing. It's a little weird. There's another paragraph still to be written. . #USER# üò∑ me too. I've learned that people don't realize that we're all, to varying degrees, a little insane right now and assess every action or decision on that basis. Global pandemics cause insanity and the actual disease. :) . #USER# Yum. Plus, you reminded me that I should do this, too. I made a copycat Cinnabon recipe in 2020 that was really good. I should do that again. . #USER# At the risk of random trolls latching on, Canada's approach of using independent, bi-partisan institutions for everything from establishing electoral districts to running elections (rooted in law) has some merit. I know that's blasphemous to the US Constitution. . #USER# #USER# #USER# We need wall-to-wall coverage of all the details. If the people really understand, there will be huge support for change on this issue....everywhere in the world. Five minute TV segments aren't going to cut it. . Oh Good Preston Manning's on CBC. #HASHTAG# . #USER# I miss when the perception of conflict was a thing to be avoided. . #USER# They said, "sir, is everything terrible?" And, I said, "It's the worst it's ever been." . #USER# Unless there is some unknown process for the evolution of human nature, we'll remain culturally tribal forevermore. This shouldn't be an issue, except believing that your tribe is better seems to be baked into the species. . #USER# #USER# #USER# A universal coronavirus vaccine is in development. Because coronaviruses are so prevalent, no vaccine will stop infection. Like the flu vaccine, they will prevent the worst outcomes. It's enough. . #USER# #USER# #USER# Except that Biden didn't staff his campaign with felons who had questionable ties to Russia and other hostile nations, and he received 6 million more votes, and your guy has lost 29 legal challenges. Otherwise, sure, almost exactly the same. . #USER# Looks like a good one. I just tasted the one I posted. It's an excellent cake, too. Great flavour. . How did I not know that Fox News was tweeting again? Tucker is safe now I presume? . "Among their former clients are investors and operators for the now-canceled Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which was supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany, as well as Russian state-controlled banks and others." #URL# . #USER# That's muenster-ous. Sorry, best I could do while working... :) . #USER# I want to read the book that talks about how reasonable people could have followed along and humoured Monsieur Wacko, at the risk of their own futures. . #HASHTAG# is real. "Loggia added that the findings further support the notion that stressful events might be accompanied by brain inflammation. ‚ÄúThis could have important implications for developing interventions for a broad number of stress-related disorders,‚Äù he said." #URL# . #USER# #USER# Synchronicity.

Roger must be so upset. . #USER# #USER# I hear you. Everybody has their own position, so even if I feel okay with vaccinated people, others don't. It's like every element of life is just one big annoyance. . Zero links to the Oath Keepers story on the website. There's an actual news report if you search. Go to 1:07 minutes and look at quote they chose to use. They picked one to "show" they were "independent" operators. NOT connected to anybody OK? Uh uh.  :) #URL# . Newsmax's own James Rosen gets his turn:  "A recent poll says that XX% of people say POTUS is mentally unfit. Why do they think that?"  POTUS:  I have no idea (points to next reporter)  This actually happened. . #USER# I just don't know what is happening to our freedoms, Myles... :) . A 2 out hit. Huh. Never would have thought that woudl happen. Be a hero Kev. #HASHTAG# . #USER# Yeah, that's crazy. I would have thought they would be queuing up healthcare people straight away. I don't understand that one at all. I can't think of a reason they couldn't do healthcare with the cohort they are doing now. . I find it wonderfully ironic that Trump's "big lie", up to and including the Capitol Riot, has given Joe Biden a level of moral authority he otherwise might not have had. So much winning, Don. . #USER# #USER# #USER# I could make a grilled cheese sandwich while I was waiting to connect. :) #URL# . #USER# I didn't know that, but it doesn't surprise me. One of the biggest areas to save labour hours is in laundry work. Huge time sucker since washing clothes became a thing. :) . #USER# I can believe it. I guess if we can keep it to one truck, we win. . Something else is fascinating about this story, I just a tweet from Sputnik News that says the Russian's say it was probably wild animals. Russia couldn't be trying to prop up China with misinformation, or anything, right? That's just crazy. #URL# . Another rainfall warning for lower BC. The poor beggars. Geez. Give them a break. . Because I make Christmas dinner in the same way my mother did (probably the way her mom did before her), I love to serve old-fashioned, soft, buttery dinner rolls for the extra bit of authenticity.  Today's baking adventure.... #URL# . #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Again, I'm sorry you don't believe in the science going on in every country in the world. I wish you did. .

I just got trolled by some pretty interesting people on the other side (waaay on the other side) of the convoy battle. Looking at their TLs, I am becoming aware of the size of the fringe-right media ecosystem in Canada. I have no idea where most of those mastheads come from. . How it started/how it's going. I want to hug her so much! #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG# #URL# #URL# . #USER# It is terrific news. I didn't believe it would happen, and I'm very happy for him. . Going to a 6:30 showing of #HASHTAG#. Looking forward. . #USER# #USER# Wasn't that always the plan? Vlad plays the long game. . #USER# Good morning Karen. It happens. I think it might have been the same way for me if I didn't get lucky in the 1st two lines. . JB not well enough for 3B, EE doesn't hit when playing 1B, Smoak, Joey out and Thole in. Did I miss anything? #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# All of you seem to have covered Tabby's body of work. Well done. :) . #USER# According to the folks I talked to, they want to be sure that this data holds. Experts are still hopeful, just not convinced yet. . That time that foreign policy was firmly grounded in religious beliefs. #HASHTAG# #URL# . #USER# I was wondering who would be the first to say so... :) . But...but...Vladimir said he didn't do it! So hard to know who to believe. #HASHTAG# #URL# . #USER# I don't recall 45's mental fitness ever being questioned in a presser. . Omicron appears more contagious, less dangerous than other variants #URL# . According to the related tweets on this story, I need to warn y'all that the government is just looking for ways to track you &amp; generally control every aspect of your life. That's sad to hear -- the issue was never public health at all. #URL# . #USER# I doubt many have followed as closely as they have since 2016. :) We always pay attention to the big stories because they can often affect us in some way. I hadn't paid close attention over the Obama years. I had no idea the Tea Party thing was as bad as it was. I was shocked. . #USER# I'm not surprised that that media keeps stirring pots so vehemently; but folks are exhausted with non-stop breaking news. If I bothered to search, I'm sure I made 2 or 3 predictions that it would be huge hit if/when he was out of office. . 6, I think.   Adorable memory: We had to go to Windsor on the 25th &amp; had to open presents Xmas eve. I still believed, so my Dad took presents, running between the front &amp; back doors wringing the doorbell &amp; leaving gifts. I kept going from door to door, so excited that Santa came. #URL# . It never stops. #HASHTAG#  "Stern said the Flynn associates asked him to dig up campaign finance information or potentially embarrassing information about GOP lawmakers who were unsupportive of the audits, which he saw as potentially ‚Äúextortion." #URL# . #USER# #USER# I hope the networks carry the parts where he talked about citizen responsibility, too. It was great! . #USER# Without 90% of all people vaccinated/recovered, there is no herd immunity now. A lower % would have worked before Delta. Nature will continue to its efforts to establish it, though. . #USER# Awesome. When I did that earlier this week, it was a great day! :) . #USER# Agree. Ah well, now I can go back to hating both teams again. So, my universe is ordered once again. :) . #USER# I'm 100% aligned with that thinking. I've witnessed the full gamut of emotions from high degrees of worry to low levels of concern. The one thing we can't change is that people will find their emotional equilibrium at a pace that's normal for them. Arrival times will differ. . #USER# Those who recover from any viral infection no longer shed the virus once the active infection resolves? It has nothing to do with immunity levels. We already know reinfections are possible whether someone recovered from covid, or was vaccinated. Infected/Reinfected = shedding. . #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Unemployment in Canada in March, 2020 was 7.5%. Today, 6.9%. Inflation is being driven by a very hot labour market as economy recovers. Wages are going up. The govt is well aware of it. But, at this point in recovery, they would not want higher interest rates. They will come. . #USER# "Huawei emphasizes it is not a state-controlled enterprise and that it would never do the bidding of spymasters from China or any other country." Phew! I was worried for a minute there. . #USER# ...individual cells ü§Ø  "With it, they can finally go from a complete human organ to a zoomed-in view of the body‚Äôs tiniest blood vessels and even individual cells." . #USER# I wonder if that love migrated over to the Ottawa Valley. My dad loved plain doughnuts and he came from Pontiac County, PQ; across the river from Pembroke. . Over the last couple of days, I had some limited engagement with folks who don't think the way I do. Not something I do often, but it was civil and OK. Just now, this showed up as trending on my TL. #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG# #URL# . I feel more sad than I thought I would. I really enjoyed having Semien as part of the #HASHTAG#.

I love the idea of being able to wash them. . #USER# #USER# I think we'll be able to be legitimately optimistic very soon. Even Chrystia Freeland said today that we are ready for it, and not to panic. I think the governments want to be sure that results translate to our population conditions...that's all. . For all the non-peaceful, and the non-respectful folks, they can put it on their resume. That should take them far.... #URL# . #USER# I've made Julia's recipe for this dish before (&amp; an easier recipe prior to that). I did it when the lockdowns were raging. It's wildly good.
